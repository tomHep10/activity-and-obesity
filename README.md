# Activity and Obesity
In this analysis, I explored the relationship between Walk Score (a measure of pedestrian accessibility) and Obesity Rates across different states. Using Pandas and Python's correlation function, I calculated the correlation coefficient between these two variables.

The analysis yielded a correlation coefficient of -0.47, indicating a moderate negative correlation. This suggests that states with higher walkability tend to have lower obesity rates.
